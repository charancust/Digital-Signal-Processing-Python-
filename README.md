# Digital-Signal-Processing-Python-
This project focuses on the implementation of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques using python.

## Contents:

The following were implemented using python.

Note: These techniques were implemented without calling the built-in functions as this project focuses on the understanding of the math behind these techniques. User-defined functions were created using basic libraries such as numpy and scipy. Matplotlib was used for the visualization.

1. Generation of a signal.

2. Basic operations on a signal.

3. Convolution.

4. Computation of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

5. Properties of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

6. Efficient computation of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

7. Linear filtering of long sequences.

8. Design of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter.

9. Design of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter.

The codes were implemented in the Spyder IDE.
